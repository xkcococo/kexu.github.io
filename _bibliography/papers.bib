  abstract={There have been increasing calls for clinicians to document social determinants of health (SDOH) in electronic health records (EHRs). One potential source of SDOH in the EHRs is in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) Z codes (Z55â€“Z65). In February 2018, ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting approved that all clinicians, not just the physicians, involved in the care of a patient can document SDOH using these Z codes.}
