Therefore, it is of interest to document such viral outbreak related emotional stress data in the community with known molecular and patho-physiological parameters of the affected individuals. We provide a concise, coherent, critical, precise, specific and direct narration of such events from a community research viewpoint using known molecular data in this editorial.},

  abstract={Due to the development of next-generation RNA sequencing technologies, there has been tremendous progress in research involving determining the role of genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics in complex biological systems. However, scientists have realized that information obtained using earlier technology, frequently called “bulk RNA-seq” data, provides information averaged across all the cells present in a tissue. Relatively newly developed single-cell (single-cell RNA sequencing [scRNA-seq]) technology allows us to provide transcriptomic information at a single-cell resolution. Nevertheless, these high-resolution data have their own complex natures and demand novel statistical data analysis methods to provide effective and highly accurate results on complex biological systems. In this review, we cover many such recently developed statistical methods for researchers wanting to pursue scRNA-seq statistical and computational research as well as scientific research about these existing methods and free software tools available for their generated data. This review is certainly not exhaustive due to page limitations. We have tried to cover the popular methods starting from quality control to the downstream analysis of finding differentially expressed genes and concluding with a brief description of network analysis.},

	ABSTRACT={Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global need for vaccines to prevent the disease is imperative. To date, several manufacturers have made efforts to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. In spite of the success of developing many useful vaccines so far, it will be helpful for future vaccine designs, targetting long-term disease protection. For this, we need to know more details of the mechanism of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we first detected pairwise differentially expressed genes among the healthy, mild, and severe COVID-19 groups of patients based on the expression of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, respectively. The CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells dataset contains 6 mild COVID-19 patients, 8 severe COVID-19 patients, and 6 healthy donors, while the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells dataset has 15 mild COVID-19 patients, 22 severe COVID-19 patients, and 4 healthy donors. Furthermore, we utilized the deep learning algorithm to investigate the potential of differentially expressed genes in distinguishing different disease states. Finally, we built co-expression networks among those genes separately. For CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we identified 6 modules for the healthy network, 4 modules for the mild network, and 1 module for the severe network; for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we detected 6 modules for the healthy network, 4 modules for the mild network, and 3 modules for the severe network. We also obtained hub genes for each module and evaluated the differential connectivity of each gene between pairs of networks constructed on different disease states. Summarizing the results, we find that the following genes TNF, CCL4, XCL1, and IFITM1 can be highly identified with SARS-CoV-2. It is interesting to see that IFITM1 has already been known to inhibit multiple infections with other enveloped viruses, including coronavirus. In addition, our networks show some specific patterns of connectivity among genes and some meaningful clusters related to COVID-19. The results might improve the insight of gene expression mechanisms associated with both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, expand our understanding of COVID-19 and help develop vaccines with long-term protection.}
