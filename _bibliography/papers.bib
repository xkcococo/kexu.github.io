  abstract={There have been increasing calls for clinicians to document social determinants of health (SDOH) in electronic health records (EHRs). One potential source of SDOH in the EHRs is in the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) Z codes (Z55–Z65). In February 2018, ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines for Coding and Reporting approved that all clinicians, not just the physicians, involved in the care of a patient can document SDOH using these Z codes.}

  abstract={Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevalence remains elevated globally. We have previously shown that a one-week lifestyle “immersion program” leads to clinical improvements and sustained improvements in quality of life in moderate to high atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk individuals. In a subsequent year of this similarly modeled immersion program, we again collected markers of cardiovascular health and, additionally, evaluated intestinal microbiome composition. ASCVD risk volunteers (n = 73) completed the one-week “immersion program” involving nutrition (100% plant-based foods), stress management education, and exercise. Anthropometric measurements and CVD risk factors were compared at baseline and post intervention. A subgroup (n = 22) provided stool, which we analyzed with 16S rRNA sequencing. We assessed abundance changes within-person, correlated the abundance shifts with clinical changes, and inferred functional pathways using PICRUSt. Reductions in blood pressure, total cholesterol, and triglycerides, were observed without reduction in weight. Significant increases in butyrate producers were detected, including Lachnospiraceae and Oscillospirales. Within-person, significant shifts in relative abundance (RA) occurred, e.g., increased Lachnospiraceae (+58.8% RA, p = 0.0002), Ruminococcaceae (+82.1%, p = 0.0003), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (+54.5%, p = 0.002), and diversification and richness. Microbiota changes significantly correlated with body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP), cholesterol, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), glucose, and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) changes. Pairwise decreases were inferred in microbial genes corresponding to cancer, metabolic disease, and amino acid metabolism. This brief lifestyle-based intervention improved lipids and BP and enhanced known butyrate producers, without significant weight loss. These results demonstrate a promising non-pharmacological preventative strategy for improving cardiovascular health.}

  abstract={Background
Conventional cardiology practice often focuses on management pre and post interventional therapy and defers cardiovascular preventive strategies to “usual care” providers. This study investigated whether a multidisciplinary preventive cardiology clinic model, focusing on nutrition and lifestyle education/modification, was associated with improved patient cardiovascular risk compared to conventional clinic care.

Methods
We identified patients enrolled in our preventive clinic compared to 2 conventional cardiology clinics (general and interventional) between January 2016 and October 2020. Cardiovascular risk profile, weight, blood pressure, and lipid profile including LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) were collected at baseline and each follow-up visit. Comparative analysis was performed on initial and last follow-up (median time 6 and 16 months), then stratified into primary and secondary prevention. A propensity score-matched analysis was done to adjust for baseline covariates and statin use.

Results
Among a cohort of 239 patients, enrollment in preventive clinic (n=99) was associated with greater weight loss compared to conventional clinics (n=140) (mean -1.7kg vs +0.1kg, p 0.007). Preventive clinic was associated with greater reduction in LDL-C (mean -24.8 vs -7.1, p 0.021), TC (mean -29.3 vs -2.0, p 0.003) and TG (mean -19.7 vs +13.3, p 0.002) on initial follow-up, with a similar association on longer follow-up. The association with reduction in TG was observed in both primary and secondary prevention, but reduction in LDL-C and TC was only significant in secondary prevention. In a multiple linear regression model, preventive clinic was independently associated with greater LDL-C reduction (b -15.7, r -0.2, p 0.043, as well as in secondary prevention b-25.7, r -0.3, p 0.034). After matching, preventive clinic remained associated with greater LDL-C reduction (b -14.7, r -0.3, p 0.038).

Conclusion
Adherence to a multidisciplinary preventive clinic model is associated with greater weight loss and a more favorable lipid panel compared to conventional care, with the potential for greater impact in secondary prevention.}

  abstract={Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented need for population-level clinical trials focused on the discovery of life-saving therapies and treatments. However, there is limited information on perception of research participation among perinatal populations, a population of particular interest during the pandemic.

Methods: Eligible respondents were 18 years or older, currently pregnant or had an infant (≤12 months old), and lived in Florida within 50 miles of sites participating in the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium. Respondents were recruited via Qualtrics panels between April and September 2020. Respondents completed survey items about barriers and facilitators to participation and answered sociodemographic questions.

Results: Of 533 respondents, most were between 25-34 years of age (n=259, 49%) and identified as White (n=303, 47%) non-Hispanic (n=344, 65%). Facebook was the most popular social media platform among our respondents. The most common barriers to research participation included poor explanation of study goals, discomforts to the infant, and time commitment. Recruitment through healthcare providers was perceived as the best way to learn about clinical research studies. When considering research participation, 'myself' had the greatest influence, followed by familial ties. Non-invasive biological samples were highly acceptable. Hispanics had higher positive perspectives on willingness to participate in a randomized study (p=0.009). Education (p=0.007) had significant effects on willingness to release personal health information.

Conclusion: When recruiting women during the pregnancy and postpartum periods for perinatal studies, investigators should consider protocols that account for common barriers and preferred study information sources.  Social media-based recruitment is worthy of adoption.
