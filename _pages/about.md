Greetings! My name is Ke Xu and I am a Biostatistician at [Vanderbilt University Medical Center](https://www.vumc.org/biostatistics/vanderbilt-department-biostatistics). I have a passion for utilizing data to improve human health and have obtained two Master of Science degrees in [Biostatistics](https://biostat.ufl.edu/) and [Biomedical Informatics](https://hobi.med.ufl.edu/) from the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/).

I specialize in omics analysis, particularly in the areas of longitudinal correlation for microbiome analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics. Additionally, I am involved in research that combines resting-state fMRI imaging data with genomics data. My background includes extensive experience as a Research Assistant at UF Health Cancer Center, where I have worked extensively in the fields of cancer and cardiovascular disease.

Please feel free to visit my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NIW-2ZgAAAAJ&hl=en), [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ke-xu-967251234/), and <a href="/assets/pdf/CV_Ke_Xu.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> for a more in-depth look at my experience and qualifications.

It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance! :blush:
