Hi! My name is Ke Xu, currently a Biostatistician of Department of Biostatistics at @@. I received my first MS degree in [Biostatistics](https://biostat.ufl.edu/) in 2019 and my second MS degree in [Biomedical Informatics](https://hobi.med.ufl.edu/) in 2022 at University of Florida.

My research focuses on evaluating the association between breastfeeding status with infant health using multi-omics data. I also focus on research that improves the recruitment of peripartum women in clinical research studies.

Here is my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NIW-2ZgAAAAJ&hl=en), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ke-xu-967251234/), and my <a href="/assets/pdf/CV_Ke_Xu.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.
 
 
 
It is pleasure to meet with you! :blush:
